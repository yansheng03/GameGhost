            <h3>Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
            <p>Survival is just the beginning.<br>
                Six years have passed since the biological disaster in Raccoon City.
                Agent Leon S. Kennedy, one of the survivors of the incident, has been sent to rescue the president's
                kidnapped daughter.
                He tracks her to a secluded European village, where there is something terribly wrong with the locals.
                And the curtain rises on this story of daring rescue and grueling horror where life and death, terror
                and catharsis intersect.

                Featuring modernized gameplay, a reimagined storyline, and vividly detailed graphics,
                Resident Evil 4 marks the rebirth of an industry juggernaut.

                Relive the nightmare that revolutionized survival horror.</p>

            <h3>Dead By Daylight</h3>
            <p>Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage
                Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being

                Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays
                in first-person and is more focused on their prey.
                The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the
                Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you
